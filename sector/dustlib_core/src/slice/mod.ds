// slice/mod.ds: Module declaration and re-exports for slice-related utilities and implementations.
// This file organizes functionality associated with slices ([T]) within the dustlib_core sector.

// The Slice<T> type itself is likely a fundamental language construct, implicitly defined by the compiler/runtime,
// potentially aliased as [T]. This module provides inherent methods and potentially related traits/functions.

// Example of how inherent methods might be attached to the slice type.
// The actual type definition (Slice<T> or [T]) is likely not done here.
// This module defines operations available on slice instances.

impl<T> [T] { // Using [T] as the likely syntax for the slice type
    // Returns the number of elements in the slice.
    pub fn len(self) -> usize {
        // Implementation would access the slice's internal length field.
        0 // Placeholder
    }

    // Returns true if the slice has a length of 0.
    pub fn is_empty(self) -> bool {
        self.len() == 0
    }

    // Returns a reference to an element or subslice, without doing bounds checking.
    // Safety: The caller must ensure the index is within bounds.
    pub unsafe fn get_unchecked(self, index: usize) -> &T {
        // Implementation would perform unchecked indexing.
        // This is a placeholder.
        loop {} // Cannot return a reference without a real implementation or memory access
    }

    // Returns an iterator over the slice.
    // pub fn iter(self) -> Iter<T> {
    //     // Implementation would create an iterator struct initialized with the slice.
    //     Iter::new(self)
    // }

    // Many other common slice methods like split_at, first, last, binary_search, sort, etc. would go here.
}

// Potentially define traits specific to slicing or related helper types here.
// pub trait SliceIndex<T> { ... }

// Define submodules if complex logic is needed (e.g., for iterators).
// mod iter;
