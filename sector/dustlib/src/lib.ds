/// Top‑level forge for dustlib.
///
/// This file aggregates the various forges that make up the core
/// library.  Each sub‑module lives in its own `.dust` file (e.g.
/// `collections.dust`, `math.dust`, etc.).  Importing `dustlib`
/// brings all of these definitions into scope.

forge dustlib {
    // Placeholder aggregator forge.  Actual exports are defined in
    // individual files.  The Dust compiler will load all forges in
    // this crate automatically.
